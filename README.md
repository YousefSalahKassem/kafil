# Themes

## Overview
Flavors in themes refer to different variations within a theme, offering both light and dark modes. <br />
Each flavor comprises a distinct color palette and theme styling, providing users with a customized visual experience.

1. **Flavors**: Variants within a theme, each comprising:
   - Light Mode
   - Dark Mode

2. **Color and Theme**: Specific attributes defining each flavor.
   - **Color Palette**: Set of colors used in both light and dark modes.
   - **Theme Styling**: Design elements, such as typography, layout, and visual components specific to each flavor.

### Code Example
```dart
// Accessing the 'black' color from the current app theme using the context object
Color myBlackColor = context.appTheme.black;
// Utilizing the obtained color in your Flutter widgets
Container(
width: 100,
height: 100,
color: myBlackColor,
)
```

```dart
// Accessing the current theme using the context object
ThemeData currentTheme = context.theme;
// Implementing the obtained theme in your Flutter widgets
Container(
decoration: BoxDecoration(
color: currentTheme.backgroundColor,
border: Border.all(color: currentTheme.accentColor),
),
)
```

## AppTextStyles
The `AppTextStyles` class in Flutter serves as a comprehensive text style manager, allowing for the definition and management of various text styles within a theming system.<br />
It offers a set of predefined text styles adaptable to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and responsive typography design within a Flutter application.


### Design Customization
    1. Adjusting the font size, weight, or line-height for specific text styles.
  
    2. Adding new text styles tailored to their design needs.

### Implementation Details

1. **Screen Adaptability**:
   `AppTextStyles` provides unique text styles tailored for mobile and tablet screen sizes, ensuring responsiveness and optimal readability across various devices.

2. **Lerp Method**:
   The `lerp` method allows for smooth transitions or transformations between text styles by linearly interpolating between two instances of `AppTextStyles`.

### Code Example
```dart
// Accessing the headlineMedium text style using the context object
TextStyle myHeadlineMediumStyle = context.textTheme.headlineMedium;
// Implementing the obtained style in your Flutter widgets
Text(
'Your Text Here',
style: myHeadlineMediumStyle,
)
```

### AppTheme Widget
The `AppTheme` widget in Flutter is a pivotal component for managing and applying various themes within an application. Leveraging Flutter Bloc for state management, it facilitates dynamic theming capabilities.

## Overview
`AppTheme` connects theme management and the user interface, enabling seamless switching and application of different themes within the app.

### Initialization

To implement the `AppTheme` widget, integrate it within the widget tree. Define a builder function that accepts the generated `ThemeData` to be applied.

### Code Example

```dart
AppTheme(
builder: (theme) {
return MaterialApp(
theme: theme,
// Other MaterialApp configurations
);
},
)
```

# Routing

The `RouteArg` library provides a set of classes and structures for handling different types of route arguments in a Flutter application.


### Types of RouteArgs

1. **NoArg:**
   - Represents routes with no arguments, indicating that no data is passed to the route.

2. **SimpleQueryArg<T>:**
   - Represents routes with a single query argument of type `T`. It allows passing a single argument to the route.

3. **SimpleExtraArg<T>:**
   - Represents routes with an extra argument of any type `T` along with a route. It includes a `getExtra` method to retrieve the extra argument when needed.


### AppRouteUtils Extension

The `AppRouteUtils` extension provides convenient methods for navigating, pushing, and replacing routes based on the `AppRoute` class.

| Method     | Description                                                       |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `navigate` | Navigate to the specified route without allowing a back action.  |
| `push`     | Pushes the specified route, allowing a back action.               |
| `replace`  | Replaces the current route in the stack with the specified route. |

### Code Example

```dart
// for no arguments.
myNoArgRoute.navigate(context);
```
